## 📊 Dashboard (Power BI)

Developed an interactive dashboard that highlights:
- Attrition distribution by gender, age group, tenure, employment type, and satisfaction levels
- Key reasons for separation (e.g., work-life balance, relocation, career move)
- Insights by employee roles (e.g., teachers, permanent staff, etc.)

## 📌 Recommendations

- **Enhance Work-Life Balance Policies:**
  Since poor work-life balance is the most cited reason for attrition, introduce flexible work schedules, remote/hybrid options, and workload redistribution initiatives.

- **Focus on Female Retention Strategies:**
  With higher attrition among female employees, implement mentorship programs, career growth support, and safe, inclusive workplace practices to boost engagement.

- **Address Early Career Relocation Issues:**
  Consider offering relocation assistance, hybrid roles, or location flexibility to reduce turnover among early career professionals.

- **Improve Job Satisfaction Across Genders:**
  Conduct pulse surveys and implement role redesign initiatives to address dissatisfaction, especially among male employees.

- **Review Promotion and Recognition Framework:**
  Low satisfaction with promotions, especially among females and early career staff, suggests the need to reassess fairness and transparency in advancement.
