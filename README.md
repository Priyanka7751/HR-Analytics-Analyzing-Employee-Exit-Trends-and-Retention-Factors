## 🔍 Key Insights

- Work-life balance emerged as the top attrition reason across all employees

- Early career employees often leave due to relocation
- Mid-career employees leave primarily for private sector opportunities
- Permanent full-time employees frequently cited workload as a reason for exit

## 📌 Recommendations

- **Enhance Work-Life Balance Policies:**
  Since poor work-life balance is the most cited reason for attrition, introduce flexible work schedules, remote/hybrid options, and workload redistribution initiatives.

- **Focus on Female Retention Strategies:**
  With higher attrition among female employees, implement mentorship programs, career growth support, and safe, inclusive workplace practices to boost engagement.

- **Address Early Career Relocation Issues:**
  Consider offering relocation assistance, hybrid roles, or location flexibility to reduce turnover among early career professionals.

- **Improve Job Satisfaction Across Genders:**
  Conduct pulse surveys and implement role redesign initiatives to address dissatisfaction, especially among male employees.

- **Review Promotion and Recognition Framework:**
  Low satisfaction with promotions, especially among females and early career staff, suggests the need to reassess fairness and transparency in advancement.
